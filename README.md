# PotterNumberGenerator

I have a project which is basically a audio-based multiple choice quiz. See [HERE](http://www.jackmorton.com/work/creating-an-immersive-game-for-audible/).

A few different versions exist with different themes/content. One consists of only clips from Jim Dale reading from the Harry Potter series. I needed an easy way to generate wrong answers that would be the same for every station to satisfy the need for a even playing field. So, if the clip is from "The Deathly Hallows", I need 3 other unique books to display alongside.

This simple tool allows me to just type the number of the book, and automatically the 3 'wrong' book numbers are copied to my clipboard for pasting into a JSON file which feeds the game.
